# Migrating your Machine Learning code to Azure Machine Learning - Best Pratice

This tutorial will show an easy and proven way on how to get your existing

* Machine Learning training code
* Machine Learning prediction/inferencing code

running Azure Machine Learning. Furthermore, it shows how to automate it using ML pipelines and Azure DevOps (or other CI/CD platforms).

## Guided Approach

You recommend you to follow the proven step-by-step guidelines, which will cover everything from setup, running at scale, and automation:

1. [Prerequisites](00-prerequisites.md) - Setup of initial environemnt
1. [Moving training to Azure Machine Learning](01-training.md) - Moving your training code to AML
1. [Moving inferencing to Azure Machine Learning](02-inferencing.md) - Moving your prediction code to AML
1. [Automating training and scoring using ML Pipelines](03-pipelines.md) - Running training and prediction code as a ML Pipeline
