This repo features an Azure Machine Learning (AML) Acceleration template which enables you to quickly onboard your existing Machine Learning code to AML. The template enables a smooth ML development process between your local machine and the Azure Cloud. Furthermore, it includes simple examples for running your model's training and batch inferecing as [Machine Learning Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines) for automation.

If you want to follow a guided approach to use this repo, start with [migrating your first workload to AML](instructions/README.md) and walk through the individual sections.

## Getting Started

We recommend you to start with [migrating your first workload to AML](instructions/README.md) as it covers all prerequisites and outlines a simple and proven step-by-step approach.

## Contents

This repo follows a pre-defined structure for storing your model code, pipelines, etc.
